# Week 1 Exercises

## Exercise 1.1: Basic Modeling

Modify the exponential growth model to include a carrying capacity $K$:

$\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right)$

Implement this logistic growth model and compare it with exponential growth.

## Exercise 1.2: Numerical Methods

Implement Euler's method to solve the exponential growth equation numerically. Compare the accuracy with the analytical solution.

## Exercise 1.3: Parameter Exploration

Investigate how different values of $r$ affect the growth behavior. Create visualizations showing multiple scenarios.
